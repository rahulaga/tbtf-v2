Notes:
*Again this could be broken into multiple projects, the web app can be totally independent
*Adding rest prefix so we can serve HTML from same server
*Added AngularJS and Bootstrap
*Partially implemented UI for a Bank teller
*Creating two controllers just to show but could have been a single one. Note how angular boundry makes them completely independent
