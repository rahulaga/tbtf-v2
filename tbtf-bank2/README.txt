Notes:
*Again this could be broken into multiple maven projects, specially the Repositories
*Added Log4j binding
*Note use of Spring property placeholder
*Note testing at each "layer" of code - testing repository and service which may seem duplicated but it is essential to TDD
*Partially implemented services, Repositories and tests
